description: "Execute your first cross-chain swap using NEAR Intents in under 5 minutes"
---

## What you'll accomplish

In this quickstart, you'll execute your first cross-chain token swap using NEAR Intents. You'll swap tokens from one blockchain to another without managing complex bridge interfaces or worrying about liquidity—NEAR Intents handles everything automatically.

**Time to complete**: 5 minutes  
**Result**: Tokens successfully transferred across chains to your destination address

## How NEAR Intents works

Instead of navigating multiple bridges and DEXs yourself, NEAR Intents lets you specify what you want (e.g., "swap 1 ETH on Ethereum for USDC on NEAR") and competitive market makers race to give you the best execution. You simply:

1. Request a quote for your desired swap
2. Send tokens to a unique deposit address
3. Receive your swapped tokens on the destination chain

Market makers compete for your business, ensuring optimal rates while the NEAR Intents protocol guarantees secure, atomic execution. If anything goes wrong, your funds are automatically refunded.

<Info>
**Prerequisites**: You'll need a small amount of tokens on a supported source chain. We recommend starting with a test amount (equivalent to $10-50) for your first swap.
</Info>

<Tip>
**New to crypto swaps?** Think of NEAR Intents as a universal translator for blockchain assets—it converts your tokens from one blockchain's "language" to another's, automatically finding the best exchange rate.
</Tip>

## Execute your first swap

<Steps>
<Step title="Get supported tokens">
  First, check which tokens and chains are currently supported by the 1Click API.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/tokens
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  const response = await fetch('https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/tokens');
  const tokens = await response.json();
  console.log(tokens);
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  response = requests.get('https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/tokens')
  tokens = response.json()
  print(tokens)
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Check>
  You'll receive a list of supported tokens with their chain, address, and symbol information.
  </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Request a quote">
  Request a quote for your intended swap. The API will return the best available rate and a unique deposit address.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/quote \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "dry": false,
      "from_chain": "ethereum",
      "from_token": "ETH",
      "from_amount": "1000000000000000000",
      "to_chain": "near",
      "to_token": "USDC",
      "destination_address": "your-near-account.near",
      "refund_address": "0xYourEthereumAddress"
    }'
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  const quote = await fetch('https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/quote', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      dry: false,
      from_chain: 'ethereum',
      from_token: 'ETH',
      from_amount: '1000000000000000000',
      to_chain: 'near',
      to_token: 'USDC',
      destination_address: 'your-near-account.near',
      refund_address: '0xYourEthereumAddress'
    })
  });
  const result = await quote.json();
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  quote = requests.post('https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/quote', 
    json={
      'dry': False,
      'from_chain': 'ethereum',
      'from_token': 'ETH',
      'from_amount': '1000000000000000000',
      'to_chain': 'near',
      'to_token': 'USDC',
      'destination_address': 'your-near-account.near',
      'refund_address': '0xYourEthereumAddress'
    }
  )
  result = quote.json()
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Tip>
  Set `dry: true` when you're just checking prices without generating a transaction. Only set it to `false` when you're ready to execute.
  </Tip>

  <Warning>
  Quotes expire after a short time. Execute your swap promptly after receiving a quote.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Send tokens to deposit address">
  Transfer your tokens to the unique deposit address provided in the quote response.

  The 1Click service will automatically detect your deposit and begin processing the swap.

  <Info>
  Save your transaction hash - you'll need it for the next optional step and for tracking your swap status.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Submit transaction hash (Optional)">
  Speed up processing by notifying 1Click of your deposit transaction immediately.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl -X POST https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/deposit/submit \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "deposit_address": "address-from-quote-response",
      "tx_hash": "0xYourTransactionHash"
    }'
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  await fetch('https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/deposit/submit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      deposit_address: 'address-from-quote-response',
      tx_hash: '0xYourTransactionHash'
    })
  });
  ```

  ```python Python
  requests.post('https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/deposit/submit',
    json={
      'deposit_address': 'address-from-quote-response',
      'tx_hash': '0xYourTransactionHash'
    }
  )
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Tip>
  While optional, submitting your transaction hash can significantly reduce processing time.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Monitor swap status">
  Check the status of your swap at any time using the deposit address.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl "https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/status?deposit_address=your-deposit-address"
  ```

  ```javascript JavaScript
  const status = await fetch(
    'https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/status?deposit_address=your-deposit-address'
  );
  const result = await status.json();
  ```

  ```python Python
  status = requests.get(
    'https://1click.chaindefuser.com/v0/status',
    params={'deposit_address': 'your-deposit-address'}
  )
  ```
  </CodeGroup>

  <Check>
  When the status shows `SUCCESS`, your tokens have been delivered to your destination address!
  </Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding swap statuses

Your swap progresses through these states:

- **PENDING_DEPOSIT** - Waiting for your token deposit
- **PROCESSING** - Deposit detected, market makers are executing your swap
- **SUCCESS** - Tokens delivered to your destination address
- **INCOMPLETE_DEPOSIT** - Deposit received but below required amount
- **REFUNDED** - Swap failed, funds returned to your refund address
- **FAILED** - Swap encountered an error

<Warning>
If your swap status is `INCOMPLETE_DEPOSIT` or `REFUNDED`, check your refund address for returned funds.
</Warning>
