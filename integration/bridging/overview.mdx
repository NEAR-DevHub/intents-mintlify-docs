![NEAR Intents Token Bridges](/images/diagrams/token-bridge-dark.svg)

NEAR Intents uses multiple bridges to move assets between the Verifier contract and external blockchains. Each bridge handles a different set of chains and has its own trust model. When a [withdrawal](/integration/verifier-contract/deposits-and-withdrawals/withdrawals) is executed, the protocol selects the appropriate bridge based on the destination chain.

<Tip>
The [Deposit/Withdrawal Service](/integration/market-makers/deposit-withdrawal-service) provides the programmatic API for moving assets through these bridges. Use it to get deposit addresses, initiate withdrawals, and monitor transfer status.

## Omni Bridge

The Omni Bridge is designed for high-throughput transfers across the most widely used chains. It supports both EVM-compatible networks and non-EVM chains like Solana and Bitcoin.

**Supported chains:** Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, BNB, Solana, Bitcoin

**Route ID:** `omni_bridge`

**Official documentation:** [Omni Bridge docs](https://docs.near.org/chain-abstraction/omnibridge/overview)

## POA Bridge

The POA (Proof of Authority) Bridge supports the widest range of chains in the NEAR Intents ecosystem. It uses a Proof of Authority consensus model to validate cross-chain transfers, covering UTXO-based chains (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, BCH, Zcash) and newer L1s (Sui, Aptos, Cardano, Starknet).

**Supported chains:** Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Gnosis, Berachain, Bitcoin, BCH, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Solana, XRP, Zcash, Tron, Sui, Aptos, Cardano, Starknet

**Route ID:** `poa_bridge`

## HOT Bridge

The HOT Bridge routes assets through the HOT/Omni protocol, extending NEAR Intents to chains like TON and Stellar, as well as newer EVM rollups like Scroll and Monad.

**Supported chains:** BNB, Polygon, Optimism, Avalanche, Scroll, Monad, TON, Stellar, LayerX, Adi, Plasma

**Route ID:** `hot_bridge`

**Official documentation:** [HOT Bridge docs](https://docs.hotdao.ai/omni-tokens)
