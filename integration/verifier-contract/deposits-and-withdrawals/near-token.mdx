Since NEAR is the native token for the NEAR blockchain, it requires special treatment. To streamline usage with other assets, NEAR is treated as a fungible token ([NEP-141](https://nomicon.io/Standards/Tokens/FungibleToken/Core)) using its wrapped form.

## Wrapped NEAR (wNEAR)

The wrapped NEAR token contract is deployed at [`wrap.near`](https://nearblocks.io/address/wrap.near). The source code can be found in the [w-near](https://github.com/near/core-contracts/tree/master/w-near) directory of the NEAR core contracts repository.

## Using NEAR tokens for deposits

There are two ways to use NEAR tokens with NEAR Intents:

### Option 1: Use 1Click or Passive Deposit Service (Recommended)

The easiest way to use NEAR tokens for deposits are through the [1Click Swap API](/integration/distribution-channels/1click-api/about-1click-api) or the [Passive Deposit/Withdrawal Service](/integration/market-makers/deposit-withdrawal-service). These services handle wrapping automatically, so you can make deposits using native NEAR tokens.

### Option 2: Wrap and deposit manually

If you're integrating directly with the Verifier contract, you must wrap your NEAR first:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wrap your NEAR">
    Call `near_deposit` on the `wrap.near` contract, attaching the amount of NEAR you want to wrap. This example wraps 0.01 NEAR:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="NEAR CLI">
        ```bash
        near call wrap.near near_deposit '{}' \
          --deposit 0.01 \
          --gas 30000000000000 \
          --useAccount your-account.near \
          --networkId mainnet
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="NEAR API JS">
        ```typescript
        import { Account, JsonRpcProvider, teraToGas, nearToYocto, KeyPairString } from "near-api-js";

        const accountId = "your-account.near";
        const privateKey = "ed25519:3D4YudU..." as KeyPairString;

        const provider = new JsonRpcProvider({ url: "https://rpc.fastnear.com" });
        const account = new Account(accountId, provider, privateKey);

        await account.callFunction({
          contractId: "wrap.near",
          methodName: "near_deposit",
          args: {},
          gas: teraToGas("30"),
          deposit: nearToYocto("0.01"),
        });
        ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deposit wNEAR into the Verifier contract">
    Call `ft_transfer_call` on `wrap.near` to deposit your wNEAR. wNEAR has 24 decimals, so 0.01 wNEAR = `10000000000000000000000`.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="NEAR CLI">
        ```bash
        near call wrap.near ft_transfer_call \
          '{"receiver_id": "intents.near", "amount": "10000000000000000000000", "msg": ""}' \
          --deposit 0.000000000000000000000001 \
          --gas 100000000000000 \
          --useAccount your-account.near \
          --networkId mainnet
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="NEAR API JS">
        ```typescript
        await account.callFunction({
          contractId: "wrap.near",
          methodName: "ft_transfer_call",
          args: {
            receiver_id: "intents.near",
            amount: "10000000000000000000000",
            msg: "",
          },
          gas: teraToGas("100"),
          deposit: 1n, // 1 yoctoNEAR
        });
        ```

        See contract interaction example in [near-api-examples](https://github.com/near-examples/near-api-examples/blob/main/near-api-js/examples/contract-interaction.ts) repository.

## Token ID

In the Verifier contract, wrapped NEAR is identified as:

```
nep141:wrap.near
```
