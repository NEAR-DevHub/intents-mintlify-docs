At NEAR Intents, we are deeply committed to implementing best practices in compliance and financial integrity. Transparency, accountability, and adherence to international standards are not just regulatory requirements for us they are guiding principles.

Our goal is to ensure that all transactions routed through NEAR Intents are secure, transparent, and fully aligned with global efforts to combat money laundering, sanctions violations, and other forms of financial crime.

## Current Implementation

### Real-time compliance screening

Every quote request undergoes automated compliance checks against multiple trusted data sources:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="NEAR Intents AML Portal" icon="shield" href="https://aml.near-intents.org">
    Internal AML screening database
  </Card>
  <Card title="Binance AML" icon="building">
    Exchange-level compliance data
  </Card>
  <Card title="AMLBot & PureFi" icon="robot">
    Third-party AML intelligence
  </Card>
  <Card title="TRM Labs" icon="chart-network" href="https://www.trmlabs.com/">
    Enhanced screening for non-dry quotes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These checks identify any overlap between addresses provided in the request and addresses flagged in external databases.

### Enhanced screening for non-dry quotes

All non-dry quote requests (actual swaps, not previews) are additionally screened against [TRM Labs](https://www.trmlabs.com/) datasets.

We automatically block quote issuance for any address that TRM Labs flags with:

- **Sanctions** (with `riskType: OWNERSHIP`)
- **Blocking behavior**

<Warning>
When a match is detected, the quote request is immediately rejected. The user or distribution channel receives a clear response that the quote has been blocked, ensuring potentially tainted flows are contained at the first interaction point.
</Warning>
