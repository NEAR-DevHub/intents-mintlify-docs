openapi: 'post /v0/quote'
---

This endpoint generates a swap quote based on your input parameters. It returns the best available rate from competing market makers and a unique deposit address for executing the swap.

<Tip>
Use `dry: true` when displaying prices to users. Only set to `false` when they're ready to execute the swap to reduce system load.
</Tip>

<Warning>
Quotes expire after a short time. Execute your swap promptly after receiving a quote.
